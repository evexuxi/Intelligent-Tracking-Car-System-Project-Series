# :memo::bulb:Intelligent Tracking Car System Project-Series

In the course, **Artificial Intelligence System Experiment**, we were required to team up to complete a competition on intelligent car tracking and pedestrian and zebra crossing recognition. The knowledge and activities involved includes pruning, YOLOv5 models, embedded development, etc.

# :construction:PRUNING TRAINING

This assignment required the completion of VGG11 model pruning experiments and training and testing on the publicly available dataset CIFAR10. We practiced this assignment to master how to lighten the network so that we can use pruning to improve model inference in the subsequent competition.
